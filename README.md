# Predicting Client Subscription to Term Deposits with Machine Learning  

This project addresses a **classification task**, aiming to predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit using data from the **Bank Marketing dataset**, obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank%2Bmarketing).  

The dataset contains comprehensive information on marketing campaigns, including:  
- Client demographic details  
- Communication records  
- Campaign performance metrics  

## Models Used  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Neural Network Classifier**  

## Project Highlights  
- Extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering were conducted to enhance model accuracy.  
- The models were evaluated based on:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  

## Findings  
- **Random Forest Classifier**:  
  - Delivered consistent and accurate predictions with strong interpretability.  
  - Demonstrated effectiveness on structured datasets like Bank Marketing.  
- **Neural Network Classifier**:  
  - Exhibited high predictive capacity and captured complex data patterns.  
  - Well-suited for identifying intricate feature relationships.  

## Summary  
Both models successfully addressed the classification challenge, proving their relevance for predictive analytics in the financial sector. A comprehensive comparison of model performance and evaluation metrics is presented in the final report.
